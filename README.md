This package can generate a URLs with an expiration date and signature to prevent unauthorized access.

```php
echo $signedUrl->sign('https://myapp.com', 30);
// => The generated url will be valid for 30 days
```
This will output an URL not unlike `https://myapp.com/?expires=1439223344&signature=2d42f65bd023362c6b61f7432705d811`.

## Install

The package can installed via Composer:
```
$ composer require spatie/signedurl
```

## Usage

A`Spatie\SignedUrl\SignedUrl`-object can sign and validate signed URLs. The secret key is used to
sign signatures.

```php
use Spatie\SignedUrl\SignedUrl;

$signedUrl = new SignedUrl('mysecretkey');
```

### Generating URLs

Signed URLs can be generated by providing a regular URL and an expiration date to the `sign()` method.

```php
$expirationDate = (new DateTime)->modify('10 days');

$signedUrl->sign('https://myapp.com', $expirationDate);

// => The generated url will be valid for 10 days
```

If an integer is provided as expiration date, the url will be valid for that amount of days.

```php
$signedUrl->sign('https://myapp.com', 30);

// => The generated url will be valid for 30 days
```

### Validating URLs

To validate a signed URL, simply call the `validate()` method. This will return a boolean.

```php
$signedUrl->validate('https://myapp.com/?expires=1439223344&signature=2d42f65bd023362c6b61f7432705d811');

// => true

$signedUrl->validate('https://myapp.com/?expires=1439223344&signature=2d42f65bd0-INVALID-23362c6b61f7432705d811');

// => false
```
