This package can create URLs with a limited lifetime. This is done by adding an expiration date
to the URL.

```php
$urlSigner = new MD5UrlSigner('randomkey');

$urlSigner->sign('https://myapp.com', 30);

// => The generated url will be valid for 30 days
```

This will output an URL that looks like `https://myapp.com/?expires=1439223344&signature=2d42f65bd023362c6b61f7432705d811`.

Image that this URL gets mailed out to the users of your application. When a user clicks on a signed URL
your application can validate it with:

```php
$urlSigner->validate('https://myapp.com/?expires=1439223344&signature=2d42f65bd023362c6b61f7432705d811');
```

## Install

The package can installed via Composer:
```
$ composer require spatie/url-signer
```

## Usage

A `Spatie\UrlSigner\UrlSigner`-object can sign and validate signed URLs. The secret key is used to generate signatures. This package provides an MD5 implementation (`Spatie\UrlSigner\MD5UrlSigner`).

```php
use Spatie\UrlSigner\MD5UrlSigner;

$urlSigner = new MD5UrlSigner('mysecretkey');
```

### Generating URLs

Signed URLs can be generated by providing a regular URL and an expiration date to the `sign` method.

```php
$expirationDate = (new DateTime)->modify('10 days');

$urlSigner->sign('https://myapp.com', $expirationDate);

// => The generated url will be valid for 10 days
```

If an integer is provided as expiration date, the url will be valid for that amount of days.

```php
$urlSigner->sign('https://myapp.com', 30);

// => The generated url will be valid for 30 days
```

### Validating URLs

To validate a signed URL, simply call the `validate()` method. This will return a boolean.

```php
$urlSigner->validate('https://myapp.com/?expires=1439223344&signature=2d42f65bd023362c6b61f7432705d811');

// => true

$urlSigner->validate('https://myapp.com/?expires=1439223344&signature=2d42f65bd0-INVALID-23362c6b61f7432705d811');

// => false
```
